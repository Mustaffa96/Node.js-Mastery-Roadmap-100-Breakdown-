Alright, let’s break down the Event Loop in Node.js in a kampung style—simple, like explaining to your neighbor over a cup of teh tarik at the warung. We’ll talk about how Node.js handles concurrency, and the difference between microtasks and macrotasks, in a way that’s easy to get.

# What’s the Event Loop?

Bayangkan Node.js macam a busy *makcik* in a kampung warung, juggling many orders at once. She only has one pair of hands (single-threaded), but she’s super efficient at handling multiple tasks (concurrency) without getting confused. The Event Loop is like her secret trick to keep everything running smoothly.

Node.js is single-threaded, meaning it can only do one thing at a time. But it uses the Event Loop to handle many tasks asynchronously—like taking orders, frying mee, and serving drinks without stopping the flow. It does this by offloading heavy tasks (like cooking) to other workers (like the V8 engine or system operations) and checking back when they’re done.

### How Node.js Handles Concurrency

Imagine the warung has one *makcik* (Node.js’s single thread) but lots of customers with orders. Instead of cooking everything herself, she:

* Takes an order (e.g., “Mee goreng satu!”) and passes it to the kitchen (system operations like file reading or network calls).
* While the kitchen works, she takes more orders or serves drinks—she doesn’t wait.
* When the kitchen signals “Mee goreng siap!”, she grabs the plate and serves it.

This is concurrency: handling many tasks by switching between them smartly, not doing them all at once (like multi-threading). The Event Loop is the *makcik*’s brain, keeping track of what’s cooking and what’s ready.

### How the Event Loop Works

The Event Loop is like a checklist the *makcik* follows in a loop, checking different “queues” (lists of tasks) to see what’s ready to do. Here’s the flow, in kampung terms:

* **Timers Queue:** Tasks like setTimeout or setInterval. Imagine *makcik* setting a timer for kuih to bake. When the timer’s up, she checks if the kuih is ready.
* **I/O Callbacks Queue:** Tasks like reading files or handling network requests. This is like *makcik* waiting for the delivery guy to bring fresh ingredients.
* **Poll Phase:** Checks for new I/O events (like the delivery arriving) and runs their callbacks.
* **Check Queue:** Handles setImmediate tasks. Like *makcik* quickly checking if the teh tarik is brewed before serving.
* **Close Callbacks:** Cleans up tasks, like closing a file after reading it.

On top of these, there are two special queues:

* **Microtask Queue:** Super urgent tasks, like Promise resolutions or queueMicrotask. Think of *makcik* quickly answering a phone call before serving the next customer.
* **Next Tick Queue:** Even more urgent, like process.nextTick. This is *makcik* dropping everything to handle a VIP customer’s request RIGHT NOW.

The Event Loop runs in a cycle:

* Check the **Next Tick Queue** first (VIP tasks).
* Then the **Microtask Queue** (urgent phone calls).
* Then the **Macrotask Queues** (timers, I/O, etc.) in order.

### Microtasks vs. Macrotasks
Now, let’s talk about microtasks and macrotasks, like comparing *makcik*’s urgent errands to her regular chores.

* **Microtasks:**
  * These are high-priority, small tasks that need to be done ASAP.
  * Examples: `Promise` resolutions, `queueMicrotask`, `process.nextTick` (though `nextTick` is even higher priority).
  * Think of *makcik* getting a quick phone call from the boss saying, “Check the cash now!” She does it right after finishing her current task, before starting anything else.
  * Microtasks run **immediately after the current task** but **before macrotasks**. The Event Loop clears the entire microtask queue before moving on.

* **Macrotasks:**
  * These are regular tasks, like setTimeout, setInterval, setImmediate, or I/O operations (file reading, HTTP requests).
  * Think of *makcik* frying mee or waiting for the delivery guy. These tasks take time and are queued in the timers, I/O, or check queues.
  * Macrotasks run **one at a time per loop cycle**, after all microtasks are done.

### Example in Kampung Terms

Here’s a simple Node.js code to show how it works:

```javascript
console.log("Start: Taking orders!");

setTimeout(() => console.log("Macrotask: Mee goreng siap!"), 0);
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("Microtask: Boss called, check cash!"));
process.nextTick(() => console.log("NextTick: VIP customer wants teh tarik NOW!"));

console.log("End: Still taking orders!");
```

Output:
```
Start: Taking orders!
End: Still taking orders!
NextTick: VIP customer wants teh tarik NOW!
Microtask: Boss called, check cash!
Macrotask: Mee goreng siap!
```

### Why this order?
* `console.log` runs first (synchronous, like *makcik* shouting to customers).
* `process.nextTick` (Next Tick Queue) runs next—VIP task, highest priority.
* `Promise.then` (Microtask Queue) runs after Next Tick—urgent but not VIP.
* `setTimeout` (Macrotask, Timers Queue) runs last, after all microtasks are cleared.

### Key Points in Kampung Style
* The Event Loop is like *makcik* juggling tasks in her warung, making sure everything gets done without stopping.
* Concurrency in Node.js means handling many tasks by passing heavy work to the “kitchen” (system) and checking back later.
* **Microtasks** (like Promise or nextTick) are urgent, like answering a phone call or serving a VIP.
* **Macrotasks** (like setTimeout or I/O) are regular chores, like cooking or waiting for deliveries.
* The Event Loop prioritizes: **Next Tick > Microtasks > Macrotasks**.
